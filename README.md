# Exploratory Data Analysis

## What is EDA?

## 1. Get an initial sniff of the data

## 2. Initial cleaning up

## 3. Visualizations

In the modern era of BIG DATA, Data visualization plays an important role in extracting key insights from trillions of rows of data generated every day. Data visualization helps to tell stories by curating data into a form that is easier to understand. Below are two examples that clealy show how a good visualization helps to see the trend in data and the relationship between different features.
